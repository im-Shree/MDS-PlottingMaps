## Multi-dimensional scaling(MDS) for ploting maps

  The MDS function performs multidimensional scaling (MDS) optimization.<br> 
  It initializes a random configuration of points, iteratively updates their positions based on the gradient of the stress function, 
  and returns the optimized configuration. <br>
  It also prints the original and final stress values.<br>

'map may be up to a reflection/rotation, so need to post-process we get from MDS'
